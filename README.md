# Context: This dataset contains feature vectors representing 12,330 sessions of online shoppers, where each session belongs to a different user within a year.

**Project Focus:** The project allowed me to explore both classification and clustering algorithms. I investigated how to group similar online shopper sessions and apply predictive models. This project further strengthened my understanding of clustering techniques, providing a foundation for tackling similar problems in the future.
